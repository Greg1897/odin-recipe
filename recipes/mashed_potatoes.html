        <h2>Want the creamiest mashed potatoes? Use Yukon Gold potatoes, lots of butter, and cream. 
            This recipe makes the best mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, or any holiday in between.</h2>

            <p>Everybody seems to have their favorite way of making mashed potatoes.
                 Some cook them with the peel on, some without. Some add a little of the cooking water
                  to the mashed potatoes for extra starch. </p>
            <p>I have found that the single thing that makes the biggest difference for making perfect creamy, 
                heavenly potatoes is the type of potatoes you use. </p>
            <P>Most people use starchy Russets for mashed potatoes. With their high starch and low water content, 
                they're good for baking, for making French fries, and for mashing. 
                Here's my secret thoughâ€”even better than Russets for mashing are Yukon Golds. </P>
            <p>They're a little more expensive than Russets, but worth it! 
                They're naturally creamy when mashed, never mealy, a
                nd have a slightly buttery flavor all on their own. 
                Yukon golds make the most perfectly creamy, buttery mashed potatoes. </p>

                    </ul>

                                    <strong>Cook the potatoes: </strong>
                                    <p>Place the peeled and cut potatoes into a medium saucepan.
                                         Add cold water to the pan until the potatoes are covered by at least an inch.
                                          Add a half teaspoon of salt to the water. </p>
                                    <p>Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a boil.
                                         Reduce the heat to low to maintain a simmer, and cover. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, 
                                         or until you can easily poke through the potatoes with a fork. </p>

                                    <strong>Prep the butter and cream: </strong>
                                    <p>While the potatoes are cooking, melt the butter and warm the cream. 
                                        You can heat them together in a pan on the stove or in the microwave. </p>

                                    <strong>Drain and mash the potatoes: </strong>
                                    <p> When the potatoes are done, drain the water and place the steaming hot potatoes into a large bowl.
                                         Pour the heated cream and melted butter over the potatoes. </p>
                                    <p>Mash the potatoes with a potato masher. 
                                        Then use a strong wooden spoon (a metal spoon might bend) to beat further. </p>
                                    <p>Add milk and beat until the mashed potatoes are smooth. 
                                        Don't over-beat the potatoes or the mashed potatoes will end up gluey. </p>
                                    <p>Add salt and pepper to taste. </p>
