          <h2>This quick and easy sheet pan dinner is the three-ingredient answer to “what’s for dinner?” </h2>
          <p>Italian sausage is roasted with chunks of sweet bell peppers and red onion for a meal that’s so much greater than the sum of its parts.
               Enjoy it on its own, tossed with pasta, over rice, or even stuffed into sub sandwich rolls! </p>
          <p>I’ve turned to this sheet pan recipe time and time again. It’s a streamlined version of the classic Italian-American Sausage, Peppers, and Onions,
               a meal that simmers browned Italian sausages with sautéed bell peppers, onions, garlic, tomatoes, spices, and sometimes a splash of Marsala wine. </p>
           <p>The key players—sausage, bell peppers, and onions—are simply thrown onto a sheet pan, tossed with olive oil, salt, and black 
               pepper, and roasted at high heat until the sausage is cooked through and the vegetables are tender and caramelized. 
               Both the sausage and vegetables release some of their natural juices, so you’re left with a juicy, vibrant trio that is a perfect meal for such little effort. </p>    
           <p>This recipe keeps well, stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator, for up to four days. 
               It’s a nice option if you meal prep. Make it over the weekend and rewarm in the microwave or in a 425°F oven for about 10 minutes. </p>

                           <strong>Add the sausage: </strong>
                           <p>Remove the casings from the sausage, if using links. Break the sausage into bite-sized pieces and drop them in the empty
                            spaces among the vegetables.</p>
